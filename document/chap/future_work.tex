\chapter{Future Work}

To better understand the implications of these results, future studies could address the issues found with the testing method by devising a benchmark that evaluates the performance and utility of S3 servers and its caching behavoirs more accurately through a set of access patterns tha reflect those observed in the real-world more accurately.

Additionally, further research can be done on the benefits brought by the \textit{external composability} by exploring transmissions through protocols other than HTTP and further expanding on the idea of smart communications between two proxies.
